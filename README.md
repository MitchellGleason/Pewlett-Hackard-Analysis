# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use PostgreSQL with employee data from Pewlett Hackard in order to discover the number of employees who will retire in the near future and create tailored lists to view the retirees by department and title.

## Results
- This analysis shows that there are 72,458 current employees who were born between 1952 and 1955 and who will retire in the near future

- Sorting these employees by job title shows a major disparity between senior and non-senior retiring positions

- Also worth noting is the very low number of managers of retiring age

- This analysis also shows that there are 1549 current employees who were born in 1965 and are eligable for the mentorship program

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Seen here, the so-called 'silver tsunami' will be a relatively even phenomenon throughout the four years, with approximately 18,000 employees retiring each year. Additionally, the number of retiring employees per department also remains relatively even throughout the four years, with Development, Production and Sales having the highest number of retirees each year.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The above figure shows the number of retirement age employees within each department.

This figure shows the number of non-retirement age employees within each department (employees born after 1955). Following this, each department has the following percentage of soon-to-be retiring employees.

- Customer Service: 30.28%
- Development: 29.92%
- Finance: 30.33%
- Human Resources: 30.43%
- Marketing: 29.59%
- Production: 30.34%
- Quality Management: 30.58%
- Research: 30.68%
- Sales: 30.07%

This shows that with enough hiring, there should be enough retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of employees.

Additionally, the following figure shows that for at least the next decade, these numbers should remain the same as the number of employees born in each consecutive year is relatively very similar, until employees who were born in 1965 retire when there will be a drastic decrease in the number of retirees.
